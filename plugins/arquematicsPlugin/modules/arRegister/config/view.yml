    # HTML 5 fun fact: attributes starting with 'data-' are always legal even if they are not
    # otherwise mentioned in the HTML 5 standard. Setting a consistent 'data-asset-group' attribute
    # for things that are loaded all the time forces the Apostrophe minifier to group them
    # together. Anything you then bring in with your own use_javascript or use_stylesheet calls
    # will, by default, be minified separately, avoiding the need to re-minify and re-send all of the stuff
    # you have already downloaded just because there's one more file in the set for that one action.
    #
    # Anything you add to view.yml (and therefore load 100% of the time) should also have data-asset-group: global
    #
    # See also app_a_asset_group which covers the automatically loaded CSS and JS files of Apostrophe. By default
    # that is also global since Apostrophe is in the layout = in pretty much every action
